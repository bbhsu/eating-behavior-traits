# Eating Behavior Traits

Eating behaviors can be influenced by genes. There are certain genes that have the potential to impact how we perceive and desire particular foods, and influence our eating behaviors, such as excessive snacking and difficulty feeling full.

## Snacking

Snacking can be a healthy or unhealthy behavior. Snacking on balanced foods, containing healthy fats, lean protein, fiber and low glycemic index carbohydrates, in small portions, throughout the day can help control hunger cravings and reduce total caloric intake, while snacking on junk food can have negative health effects.

Genetic markers associated with snacking behavior include variants in the receptor for leptin, an essential hormone for the regulation of food intake. People with the G/G genotype in a leptin receptor (LEPR) genetic marker were more likely to show "increased" snacking behavior. This association has not been studied in men.

If you are more likely to exhibit snacking behavior, try choosing healthy snacks, eating slowly, and reducing the size or calories of snacks.

## Hunger

While most of us know the feeling of hunger, some people feel hunger more intensely and more often than others. Susceptibility to hunger can now be partially explained by genetics. A variation in the NMB gene has been associated with increased feelings of hunger. When asked about their own eating behaviors on a questionnaire, people with a T/T genotype were more likely to report an "increased" susceptibility to hunger.

## Satiety - Feeling Full

Satiety can be described as the feeling of fullness after you eat. The FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated) gene is known to be an important factor that predisposes a person to a healthy or unhealthy level of body weight.  People who experience "difficulty in feeling full" tend to eat more without feeling satisfied.  In a 2008 study, the A/A genotype at rs9939609 in the FTO gene was associated with "difficulty in feeling full". Although this study was done in children, there is preliminary data to support that the association also holds true in adults.


## Eating Disinhibition

Eating disinhibition describes the tendency to eat more than normal in response to a stimulus, such as a tasty food or in situations that trigger overeating (e.g., emotional stress or specific social situations). In a 2010 study, the A allele of rs1726866 was "more likely" to be associated with eating disinhibition in women. The G/G genotype at the same marker was "less likely" to be associated with eating disinhibition. There is not enough scientific evidence yet to determine if this association also holds for men.


## Food Desire

Behavioral scientists have devised techniques to measure an individualâ€™s motivation to consume food and compare it with that of others. This measurement, called the reinforcing value of food, describes how much effort an individual is willing to put forth to get access to food. The reinforcing value can be determined through a series of tests in a laboratory setting. In each of those tests, the individual being tested is asked to complete a task in exchange for a small portion of his or her favorite foods. The task of the initial test is easy, so the food is not difficult to win. As the tests continue, the task gets more and more difficult until, at some point, the participant feels that the food is no longer worth the effort and decides to quit.

This experiment tells us that early quitters, when compared with late quitters, are low in food reinforcement. Using this technique, a 2007 study identified a genetic component in food reinforcement. Among people who were considered obese, those who had a specific variant (A allele) of the genetic marker rs1800497 had an "increased" likelihood to make more effort to obtain their favorite foods and eat more of them. In contrast, the G/G genotype was associated with "normal" levels of food reinforcement.


## Sweet Tooth

Craving sweet foods is sometimes described as having a "sweet tooth". People with the G/A and A/A genotypes showed an "increased" likelihood to eat more sweets and sugary foods, while people with the G/G genotype were more likely to have a "normal" intake of sugary foods.

If you have an increased likelihood to eat more sugary foods, try choosing fruit as a healthy sweet alternative.
